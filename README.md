# fitbit-deficit
Clockface for Fitbit to that shows the calorie deficit

April 2021: Abandoned project.

Activity interface does not behave as expected. It might be a bug of the SDK.

Furthermore, there is now a new SDK out that is no longer compatible with my fitbit model.

I'll come back to this after I upgrade my fitbit.
